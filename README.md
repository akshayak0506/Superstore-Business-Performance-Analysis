 ## 🔍 Business Questions Answered (SQL)

The following **business-driven SQL queries** were performed on the cleaned dataset:

1. **Revenue & Profit by Year**  
   → Identified year-wise revenue growth and profitability trends.

2. **Quarterly Profit Trend**  
   → Analyzed profit movement across quarters to detect seasonal or performance drops.

3. **Loss-Making Sub-Categories**  
   → Identified sub-categories consistently generating losses.

4. **Discount Impact Analysis**  
   → Grouped discounts into buckets to evaluate their effect on total profit.

5. **Top 10 Customers by Profit**  
   → Identified the most profitable customers contributing to overall profit.

6. **High-Revenue but Low-Profit Products**  
   → Detected products generating high sales but resulting in net losses.

7. **Profit Margin by Sub-Category**  
   → Compared profitability efficiency across product sub-categories.

8. **Loss Contribution Analysis**  
   → Calculated each sub-category’s percentage contribution to total losses using window functions.

9. **Region-wise Discount vs Profit**  
   → Compared average discount levels and profit performance across regions.

10. **Profitability by Customer Segment**  
    → Evaluated revenue, profit, and profit margin for each customer segment.

## 📈 Key Insights & Recommendations
- 📉 **High discounts (>50%) consistently lead to losses**
- 🪑 **Tables and Bookcases are major loss-driving sub-categories**
- 👥 A small group of customers contributes disproportionately to profit
- 🌍 Certain regions apply higher discounts without proportional profit gains
- 🎯 Optimizing discount strategy can significantly improve margins
